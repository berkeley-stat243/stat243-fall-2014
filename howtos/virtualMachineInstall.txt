Make sure you get the full file. If the download is interrupted you may get an error message when you try to import the appliance. The current VM is version 0.1.3 and is 2.8 Gb. If the file you download looks smaller, your download probably didn't finish.

Windows users may encounter some trouble. Try using VirtualBox version 4.3.12 [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_4_3] or 4.3.15 and not 4.3.14.

You may also need to enable virtualization in your VirtualBox settings (Settings -> System -> Acceleration and check "Enable VT-x/AMD-V". If this is greyed out, it probably means you need to enable virtualization in your BIOS.  Accessing the BIOS settings varies by the manufacturer and model, so try Googling your machine model and "BIOS settings". Once you get into the settings, you should see one of the options to enable virtualization.

To copy files between your machine and the VM, you can use shared folders, as deescribed at http://collaboratool.berkeley.edu/using-virtualbox.html. You can also drag files and folders from your machine onto/into the window of the VM.
